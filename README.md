An alternative to Windows Copilot to change Windows 11 settings via text input.

Windows 11 Copilot is not yet available in the EU? Or you don't want to trust the copilot with your data? No problem! Try my little app, which you can use to open various apps or make system settings by entering text.

<b> Responsive Windows 11 Style also in Windows 10</b>
